# Fireworks night  - Project 20 0f #100DaysOfSwift

## Description:
Another SpriteKit game project. Player can make firework go off using their fingers. They need to select fireworks of the same color, then shake their device to make them explode. 

## Key points:
UIBezierPath, SKAction follow, Emitter nodes

## Challanges:
From Hacking with Swift:

1. For an easy challenge try adding a score label that updates as the playerâ€™s score changes.
2. Make the game end after a certain number of launches. You will need to use the invalidate() method of Timer to stop it from repeating.
3. Use the waitForDuration and removeFromParent actions in a sequence to make sure explosion particle emitters are removed from the game scene when they are finished.
