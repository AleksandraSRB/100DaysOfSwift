# Selfie share  - Project 24 0f #100DaysOfSwift

## Description:
The app is showing photos of user's choosing in a collection view. When user adds a photo to the app, it automatically sends it to any other devices user is currently connected to, and any photos other (connected devices) send, will appear for the user.


## Key points:
Peer to Peer networking, MCSession, MCBrowserViewController, MCPeerID

## Challanges:
From Hacking with Swift:

1. Show an alert when a user has disconnected from our multipeer network. Something like “Paul’s iPhone has disconnected” is enough.
2. Try sending text messages across the network. You can create a Data from a string using Data(yourString.utf8), and convert a Data back to a string by using String(decoding: yourData, as: UTF8.self).
3. Add a button that shows an alert controller listing the names of all devices currently connected to the session – use the connectedPeers property of your session to find that information.
