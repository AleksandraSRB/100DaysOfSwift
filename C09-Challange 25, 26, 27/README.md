# Challange 25, 26, 27 - Milestone projects 25-27 0f #100DaysOfSwift

## Description:
Our challenge was to create a meme generation app using UIImagePickerController, UIAlertController, and Core Graphics.

Steps for the challenge from Hacking with Swift:

- Prompt the user to import a photo from their photo library.
- Show an alert with a text field asking them to insert a line of text for the top of the meme.
- Show a second alert for the bottom of the meme.
- Render their image plus both pieces of text into one finished UIImage using Core Graphics.
- Let them share that result using UIActivityViewController.
