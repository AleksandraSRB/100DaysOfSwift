# Grand Central Dispatch - Project 9 0f #100DaysOfSwift

## Description:
In this technique project we returned to project 7 to solve a critical problem using Grand Central Dispatch (GCD). 


## Key points:
Grand Central Dispatch, PerformSelector

## Challanges:
From Hacking with Swift:

1. Modify project 1 so that loading the list of NSSL images from our bundle happens in the background. Make sure you call reloadData() on the table view once loading has finished!
2. Modify project 8 so that loading and parsing a level takes place in the background. Once you’re done, make sure you update the UI on the main thread!
3. Modify project 7 so that your filtering code takes place in the background. This filtering code was added in one of the challenges for the project, so hopefully you didn’t skip it!
