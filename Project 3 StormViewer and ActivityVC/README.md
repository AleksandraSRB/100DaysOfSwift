# Storm viewer + Activity VC - Project 3 0f #100DaysOfSwift

## Description:
This first technique project - we modified project 1, added ActivityVC, so we could share images with friends.

## Key points:
UIBarButtonItem, UIActivityViewController

## Challanges:
From Hacking with Swift:

1. Try adding the image name to the list of items that are shared. The activityItems parameter is an array, so you can add strings and other things freely. Note: Facebook wonâ€™t let you share text, but most other share options will.
2. Go back to project 1 and add a bar button item to the main view controller that recommends the app to other people.
3. Go back to project 2 and add a bar button item that shows their score when tapped.
