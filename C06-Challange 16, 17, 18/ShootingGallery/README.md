# Challange 16, 17, 18 - Milestone projects 16-18 0f #100DaysOfSwift

## Description:
Our challenge was to make a shooting gallery game using SpriteKit: creating three rows on the screen, then have targets slide across from one side to the other. If the user taps on a target, fade out the target and award player with points.

Big thanks to Matt Wurl for assets and base project!

Challenges from Hacking with Swift:

- Make some targets big and slow, and others small and fast. The small targets should be worth more points.
- Add “bad” targets – things that cost the user points if they get shot accidentally.
- Make the top and bottom rows move left to right, but the middle row move right to left.
- Add a timer that ticks down from 60 seconds. When it hits zero, show a Game Over message.
- Try going to https://openclipart.org/ to see what free artwork you can find.
- Give the user six bullets per clip. Make them tap a different part of the screen to reload.
