# Challange 10, 11, 12 - Milestone projects 10-12 0f #100DaysOfSwift

## Description:
Our challenge was to create an app that lets users take photos of things that interest them, add captions to them, then show those photos in a table view. Tapping the caption should show the picture in a new view controller.
