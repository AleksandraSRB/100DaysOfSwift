# Space race - Project 17 0f #100DaysOfSwift

## Description:
In this project we created a space survival game. The player has to pilot a spaceship safely through a field of space debris. The longer player stays alive the higher their score will be.

## Key points:
Timer, linearDamping, angularDamping, collisions

## Challanges:
From Hacking with Swift:

1. Stop the player from cheating by lifting their finger and tapping elsewhere – try implementing touchesEnded() to make it work.
2. Make the timer start at one second, but then after 20 enemies have been made subtract 0.1 seconds from it so it’s triggered every 0.9 seconds. After making 20 more, subtract another 0.1, and so on. Note: you should call invalidate() on gameTimer before giving it a new value, otherwise you end up with multiple timers.
3. Stop creating space debris after the player has died.
