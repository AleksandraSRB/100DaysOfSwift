# Challange 19, 20, 21 - Milestone projects 19-21 0f #100DaysOfSwift

## Description:
Our challenge was to recreate the iOS Notes app with a navigation controller, a table view controller, and a detail view controller with a full-screen text view.

Steps for the challenge from Hacking with Swift:

- Create a table view controller that lists notes. Place it inside a navigation controller. 
- Tapping on a note should slide in a detail view controller that contains a full-screen text view. 
- Notes should be loaded and saved using Codable. You can use UserDefaults if you want, or write to a file.
- Add some toolbar items to the detail view controller – “delete” and “compose” seem like good choices. 
- Add an action button to the navigation bar in the detail view controller that shares the text using UIActivityViewController.
