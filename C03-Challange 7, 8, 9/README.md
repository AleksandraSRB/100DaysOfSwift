# Challange 7, 8, 9 - Milestone projects 7-9 0f #100DaysOfSwift

## Description:
Our challenge was to create a hangman game using UIKit. It means choosing a random word from a list of possibilities, but presenting it to the user as a series of underscores. So, if the word was “RHYTHM” the user would see “_ _ _ _ _ _”.

The user can then guess letters one at a time: if they guess a letter that it’s in the word, e.g. H, it gets revealed to make “_ H _ _H _”; if they guess an incorrect letter, they inch closer to losing. If they seven incorrect answers they lose, but if they manage to spell the full word before that they win.
