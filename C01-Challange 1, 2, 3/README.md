# Challange 1, 2, 3 - Milestone projects 1-3 0f #100DaysOfSwift

## Description:
Our challenge was to create an app that lists various world flags in a table view. When one of them is tapped, table view should slide in a detail view controller that contains an image view, showing the same flag full size. On the detail view controller, we added functionality of sharing an image using UIActivityViewController.
