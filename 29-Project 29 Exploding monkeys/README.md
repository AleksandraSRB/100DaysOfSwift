# Exploding Monkeys - Project 29 0f #100DaysOfSwift

## Description:
This is a SpriteKit game that pits two players against each other, both standing on top of buildings and both throwing exploding bananas at each other. In this project, we learned new concepts such as destructible terrain and mixing UIKit and SpriteKit together, practiced with Core Graphics. 

## Key points:
Mixing UIKit and SpriteKit: UISlider and SKView, SpriteKit texture atlases, Filling a path

## Challanges:
From Hacking with Swift:

1. Add code and UI to track the player scores across levels, then make the game end after one player has won three times.
2. Add Auto Layout rules for the UI components in our storyboard, allowing them to remain positioned neatly regardless of which iPad size is used.
3. Use the physics worldâ€™s gravity to add random wind to each level, making sure to add a label telling players the direction and strength.
